//Question6
//Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name.
// Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once,
// so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.

var Name="\t MetaVerse \n";
console.log("With Spaces: ",Name);
console.log("Without Spaces : ",Name.trim());
